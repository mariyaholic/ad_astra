Targeted verification2026-09-30 [V, bounded]: exact NASA TOI and Gaia DR3 source/RV-quality/NSS selections answered for TIC70797900,170889511,443666343. MAST strict/loosened/cone selections and TESScut sectors answered; TIC261136679 control returned50 observations. TESScut supplied7x7 FFI cutouts for TOI224 S107 (200s) and TOI2666 S8 (1800s), total13,777,920bytes; headers are TDB but retain CCD-centre barycentric correction. Eight official TESS UPDATED_2.0 PRFs retrieved from `https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/tess/models/prf_fitsfiles/start_s0004/` (camera1 CCD1/2 bracketing grids); their README documents9x9 intra-pixel sampling and1–5percent interpolation accuracy. Three ESO target spectra queries timed out at45s each, while HD10700 control answered100rows: target-query access remains inconclusive, not a global archive outage. Queries, products, hashes, release/header information and limits: `reports/lead-resolution-2026-09-30/`.
Verification tags: **[V]** = service live-fetched and read during the Tier-1 pack build (2026-09-23/24); **[K]** = knowledge-based (re-verify before relying on it for a consequential claim or dossier entry). Tag every reuse of these entries in dossiers likewise.

Service health check 2026-09-25 (per-endpoint minimal control query, from this workstation):
- **Live / answering:** MAST portal API; Gaia TAP+ (DR3); CDS TAPVizieR (VSX); CDS SIMBAD TAP; NED; IRSA TAP (AllWISE); IRSA ZTF light-curve CGI (needs `POS=CIRCLE ra dec radius`); ESO TAP obs; ESA JWST archive; SkyView (astroquery `get_images` + `basicform.pl`; the raw `runquery.pl` GET can 500 — use astroquery); Legacy Survey viewer (bricks JSON) and `portal.nersc.gov` DR10 tractor; NASA Exoplanet Archive TAP; JPL SBDB + Horizons; AstDyS; NASA Earthdata; Copernicus Data Space; MicroObservatory OWN; Skynet.
- **Targeted re-check 2026-09-27** [V, limited scope]: MAST portal `Mast.Caom.Filtered` + `Mast.Caom.Products` answered for bare TIC 70797900, 170889511, 443666343 and 121341000, returning 5/3/4/2 SPOC `LC` product metadata rows (14 total; no newly listed sector under this selection). NASA Exoplanet Archive TAP `toi` and `pscomppars` answered 30-arcsec target queries for all four, plus the TOI-6695 b known-object regression. Exact rows, query strings and UTC retrieval stamps are in `reports/lead-verification-2026-09-27/{mast_metadata,prior_art}.json` and `campaigns/toi-6695-01/REJECTION.md`. This is service and selection verification only; FFI/HLSP availability and astrophysical nondetections were not tested.
- **SIMBAD now answers** (TAP control 200): the 2026-09-25 `Tunnel connection failed` failures look like the intermittent proxy, not a SIMBAD outage — re-run any incomplete cross-match before treating it as done.
- **MPC:** the public site `minorplanetcenter.net` is unreachable from this host (DNS resolves, TCP times out on 80/443), but the **data host answers** [V 2026-09-25]: `GET https://data.minorplanetcenter.net/api/get-obs` with a JSON body `{"desigs": ["<name>"]}` and `Content-Type: application/json` returns observations (also `/api/obscodes`; `/api/` returns a hello). The `cygnus.multi` MPC adapter (`src/cygnus/multi/archives/solar_system.py`) uses this route; treat the main-site check as not tested until it answers.
- **Adapter probe 2026-09-26** (`python -m cygnus.multi archives --check all`, known-answer queries): 19 ok; `eso` TAP read-timed out (120 s) on every attempt that day; `asf`, `usgs`, `firms`, `worldview` need accounts or are browser-only (by design). IRSA ZTF CGI timed out twice (120 s, 180 s) and then answered. Verified details [V 2026-09-26]: Legacy Survey cutout `size` must be an **integer pixel count** (with `pixscale`, 0.262″/px for DR9); a float returns HTTP 500. MPC `get-obs` defaults to XML; `output_format: ["OBS80"]` returns 80-column lines (1998 SF36: 1,260 observations either way). Horizons returns an observer table with `MAKE_EPHEM=YES`, `TLIST` and `ANG_FORMAT=DEG` (Ceres at JD 2460000.5: RA 191.1653°, Dec 12.9377°). SkyBoT cone search returns a server-side `SIGBUS` error for some epochs, reproducibly on retry; the pipeline records those epochs as unanswered.
- **Mamajek mean dwarf colours/Teff table** [V 2026-09-26]: http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/EEM_dwarf_UBVIJHK_colors_Teff.txt, version 2022.04.16, sha256 `1de2edeec17bb3346e0e4e70b999de5ee29947df38474e64cddb7cfacc164b7f`. A 63-row B9V–M9.5V subset is vendored in `src/cygnus/multi/data/` with this provenance in its header (anonymous; cite Pecaut & Mamajek 2013).
- **Degraded:** ESA Sky `esasky.esa.int` — TLS certificate hostname mismatch; only enumerable with verification disabled. Use in a browser until the cert is fixed.

Scope: free access to telescope/satellite **data** and to **steerable observing time**, under the relaxed bar agreed with the user (fully anonymous where possible; simple free account acceptable).

## 0. Tier-1 baseline pack (built 2026-09-23/24)

A provenance-logged sample of every §1 archive was built by
`cygnus.ingest.tier1` (see `ANALYSIS_STACK.md`, `tools/build_pack_docs.py`)
and lives at **`cygnus:Cygnus/data/tier1/`** with per-service manifests
(sha256+md5, exact endpoints, verbatim queries) and `MASTER_MANIFEST.csv`.
**Retention (user instruction, 2026-09-24): bulky data is Drive-hosted only;
staged local copies are deleted after rclone MD5 verification.** Worktree
keeps code, ledger (`state/ledger.sqlite`), and manifests
(`docs/tier1_pack/`). Re-download any product from the recorded URLs; never
run `rclone sync` from an emptied staging dir (it would mirror the emptiness
and delete the Drive copy — use `rclone copy`).

The optional `cygnus.analysis` suite (`docs/ANALYSIS_SUITE.md`) offers bounded,
read-only reanalysis pilots for selected pack products. Its Colab notebook first
checks the manifest and SHA-256; it does not establish that Drive is mounted,
that a catalog is complete, or that an anomaly is a new object. Existing pack
fields/epochs are targeted samples, not a blind or unsurveyed sky census.

Service quirks verified live (use these; re-verify dates if claims become consequential):
- **MAST** [V 2026-09-23]: CAOM `target_name` is the TIC id (`261136679` for Pi Mensae) — cone search + nearest-target group works; exact-name probes return zero. Kepler LC subgroup is `LLC` (TESS SPOC LC is `LC`). JWST/HST cone + `obs_collection` works (`provenance_name='JWST'` is actually `CALJWST`). File API: `https://mast.stsci.edu/api/v0.1/Download/file?uri=<dataURI>`.
- **MAST re-verified 2026-09-25** [V]: TESS SPOC timeseries queries need the **bare TIC number** as `target_name` (`'197807043'` → 8 obs; `'TIC 197807043'` / `'TIC197807043'` → 0). Genuine absorption-distinct absence verified: TIC 44161614 (TOI-7176.01) returns 0 SPOC timeseries rows at every filter strictness — a 0.02° cone shows only SPOC **FFI** observations (sectors 56, 83) and no 'TESS' target_name rows; absence is target-level, not query-level. A portal that answers famous-target queries (HD 209458 → 26 734 obs) is healthy: judge "service down" only from control queries failing on the same path. `Mast.Caom.Filtered.Position` [V 2026-09-26] combines column filters with a `position` of `"ra, dec, radius_deg"` (plain `Mast.Caom.Cone` rejects the filters), so a star filed under its Kepler/K2 name (`kplr<KIC>`, `ktwo<EPIC>`) is found from its coordinates: Kepler-10 → 15 long-cadence `kplr011904151_*_llc.fits` products.
- **Gaia** [V 2026-09-23/24]: use TAP `FORMAT=csv` — astropy's VOTable *binary* reader decodes var-char fields with a hardcoded ascii codec and raises on non-ASCII bytes; pyvo fails similarly on tap_schema descriptions. Live table names: `nss_acceleration_astro` (not `nss_acceleration`), `vari_eclipsing_binary` (not `vari_eb`); `xp_sampled_mean_spectrum` absent from the live gaiadr3 schema dump (`xp_summary` present). NSS vetting uses `gaiadr3.nss_two_body_orbit` (columns include `nss_solution_type`, `period`, `eccentricity`, `semi_amplitude_primary`, `significance`, `flags`, `astrometric_jitter`), schema live-checked 2026-09-25.
- **CDS** [V 2026-09-23/24]: TAPVizieR `tap_schema.tables.table_name` values arrive already quote-wrapped (`"'B/vsx/vsx'"`); VSX's real id is `B/vsx/vsx` (`B/vsx` alone 400s "table not found"). Sync row caps apply; async queue can idle long.
- **ESO** [V 2026-09-24]: `ivoa.ObsCore` has no `dataRights` column (400); `access_url` is a DATALINK pointer (`/datalink/links?ID=...`) whose VOTable rows hold the actual `.fits` URLs (resolve smallest science product).
- **IRSA** [V 2026-09-23/24]: TAP works with `CONTAINS(POINT('J2000',...))=1`; AllWISE catalog table is `allwise_p3as_psd` and a 20-column list is rejected server-side (6-column subset works); `tap_schema.tables` rows come back as unnamed `col_0/col_1` columns; 2MASS point-source catalog is **not** served via TAP (image tables only). ZTF CGI (`/cgi-bin/ZTF/nph_light_curves`) accepts only `POS`+`FORMAT` (`MERGE`/`BAD_DATA` → 400 UsageFault). **ZTF light-curve CGI re-verified 2026-09-26** [V]: one VOTable table per answer, all matched objects' points pooled with per-point `oid`, `filtercode`, `ra`/`dec`, `catflags` and `hjd`/`mjd`; `hjd` is the heliocentric midpoint in UTC (it tracks the pipeline's BJD_TDB conversion minus the 69-s TDB−UTC offset, ~6 s spread); a saturated star (Kepler-10, G ≈ 10.6) returns an empty 0-row table at 2″ and 5″, while a T = 14.1 host returns 1,721 good points at 3″.
- **Legacy Survey** [V 2026-09-23/24]: the old `/api/region/tractor` and `/api/brick` are retired (nginx 404s); live routes are `/viewer/bricks/?ralo=..&rahi=..&declo=..&dechi=..&layer=...` (JSON `polys[].name` = brick names) and tractor files at `https://portal.nersc.gov/cfs/cosmo/data/legacysurvey/dr{9,10}/{north|south}/tractor/{AAA}/tractor-{brick}.fits` (documented in `dr9/files`). LS/unWISE layers: **CC BY 4.0** with required credit "Legacy Surveys / D. Lang (Perimeter Institute)" (acknowledgment page fetched 2026-09-24).
- **SkyView** [V 2026-09-23]: survey names verified against `SkyView.survey_dict` (`DSS2 Blue`, `2MASS-K`, `WISE 12`, `GALEX Near UV`, `SDSSg`); WISE requests returned HTTP 404 on 2026-09-23/24 (service unavailable).
- **NED** [V 2026-09-23]: `astroquery.ned` works but is deprecated (moved to `astroquery.ipac.ned`).

## 4. JWST free-data specifics

- **Primary and canonical: MAST** — https://mast.stsci.edu/ [V]; via `astroquery.mast`. Anonymous downloads for public data.
- **ESA mirror: ESA JWST Science Archive** — https://jwst.esac.esa.int/archive/ [V].
- Access rule [K, confirm on policy page]: products become public when each program's exclusive-access period ends — default **12 months**; commissioning/early-release data were public essentially immediately; by 2026 the large majority of Cycle 1–3 (2022–2025) observations are public. Policy page: NASA-SMD Policy 2 "Data Rights and Data Dissemination" in JDox [V-fetched; body app-gated, nav only — open in a browser to read the full text].

## 6. Worktree access mechanics & hygiene

- **Scripting stack:** `astroquery`, `pyvo` (TAP/VO), `astropy`, `lightkurve`; EO side via STAC API / openEO / direct S3 bucket reads. Tier-1 retrieval uses the byte-safe `TapDirect` client (`src/cygnus/ingest/tap.py`, CSV-first) with `astroquery` for MAST/SkyView/SIMBAD/NED search stages.
- **Downloads land in** `D:\AO_Artifacts\cygnus_scratch\` (nonsynced, disposable). Curated outputs and reports go to the connected Google Drive at `cygnus:Cygnus/` (rclone remote; scope `drive.file` — see AGENTS.md). **Retention (2026-09-24): bulk data is Drive-hosted only; staged files are deleted after rclone MD5 verification; worktree retains code + ledger + manifests.**
- **Credentials:** kept out of the repo and out of logs/transcripts: never pasted into code, dossiers, or search logs. Centralize auth in uncommitted environment files. One free account each (Earthdata, CDSE) covers all Tier-2 services; note which tokens were configured and when without logging the secrets themselves.
- **Query discipline for every retrieval:** record endpoint, exact query/selection text, UTC retrieval date, catalog/release identifier, product IDs (and checksums when served), plus package versions. This is the provenance trail dossier sections point at.
- **Rate limits:** honor each service's published concurrency policies; back off on HTTP 429/503; prefer resumable chunked downloads over restart-from-scratch.
- **Verification tags traveled with the data:** any [K] entry used in a dossier or magnitude/mass estimate must first be re-verified live (or replaced by an authoritative citation) when the claim becomes consequential.

## 2026-09-30 lead-resolution service supplement

- **Keck Observatory Archive HIRES public TAP:** `https://koa.ipac.caltech.edu/TAP/sync`, anonymous ADQL/CSV verified with five answered queries and positive control. See [official TAP guide](https://koa.ipac.caltech.edu/UserGuide/PyKOA/TAPClients.html) and `reports/lead-resolution-2026-09-30/koa_hires_archive.json` for exact queries, retrieval UTC and rows. Metadata access is verified; raw download/calibration and precise source identity are not yet tested. [HIRES tutorial](https://koa.ipac.caltech.edu/UserGuide/PyKOA/notebooks/PyKOA_HIRES_introduction.html) warns quick-look extractions are not intended for scientific analysis. No private access attempted.
- **FEROS release calibration caveat:** [official release description94](https://www.eso.org/rm/api/v1/public/releaseDescriptions/94) checked2026-09-30: barycentric correction already applied with known precision limits; dummyNaN ERR, no simultaneous-reference drift calibration, unsupervised reductions not science-grade. Public availability does not establish precisionRV validity. The25-product audit in `feros_barycentric_audit.json` records target-specific correction discrepancies without applying a replacement or claiming stellar velocities.
- **Primary CCF mask data:** [szunigaf/CCF_functions](https://github.com/szunigaf/CCF_functions), pinned commit89ba7d5bbdfa7ef7332a2b1a5bfb9646504ac618, R50G2/K0 masks and BSD license retrieved anonymously2026-09-30. Manifest preserves hashes; only mask data used, no downloaded code executed. Real-data validation remains failed/pending as documented at the pause checkpoint.

### KOA public product route verified later on2026-09-30

PyKOA1.7.2source (PyPI SHA-256 verified, text inspected only) identifies anonymous raw `https://koa.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/getKOA/nph-getKOA` and calibration-list `https://koa.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/KoaAPI/nph-getCaliblist` routes. These answered for three exact HIRES IDs in `koa_product_screen.json`. Three65536-byte FITS prefixes parsed; association lists18/59/58rows retrieved. Range ignored (HTTP200), streams manually closed at cap. Full raw/calibrationFITS retrieval, calibration suitability and componentRV are not tested. Do not construct download URLs by host-prefixing `filehand`, or assume an ASCII output's `fileurl` field is a TAP column; inspect schema/client routes. Prefix SHA-256 does not verify a complete FITS product.

### KOA HIRES Level1 route verified2026-10-11

The same official PyKOA1.7.2 source documents anonymous `cgi-bin/KoaAPI/nph-getL1list` and `cgi-bin/KoaAPI/nph-dnloadL1data`, each with instrument, parent koaid and filehand. The Level1 download endpoint differs from the raw endpoint. Three exact IDs answered; February2021 listed592 products. A bounded CCD3 flux/QA pilot retrieved22 files (4,243,380bytes), verified FITS/headers and recorded SHA256. February red orders passed browse QA, May red orders failed; this is not precision-RV certification. Wavelength convention is vacuum/heliocentric with possible sky-line zero-point shift, per the [official format](https://koa.ipac.caltech.edu/UserGuide/HIRES/extracted_products.html). HTTP200 JSON error bodies must be rejected. Exact params, retrieval UTC, source hashes and access limitations: [2026-10-11 advancement packet](reports/lead-advancement-2026-10-11/REPORT.md). This route does not establish a validated component orbit.

## 7. Google Colab runtime route (verified 2026-09-26)

- **Bridge to the agent:** Google's `colab-mcp` ([github.com/googlecolab/colab-mcp](https://github.com/googlecolab/colab-mcp)), run by the DSH harness over stdio (`uvx git+…`). One tool (`open_colab_browser_connection`) opens the Colab tab and waits up to 60 s (hardcoded) for the Colab frontend to dial back to an authenticated localhost WebSocket; after that the notebook tools (`add_code_cell`, `run_code_cell`, `get_cells`, `update_cell`, …) are proxied to the agent. Requires client support for `notifications/tools/list_changed` (DSH has it).
- **Handshake timeout (fixed 2026-09-26):** DSH's per-call MCP timeout default is 60 s, which cancelled the tool call at the same instant the server's own 60 s window closed; a later user "accept" then dialed into a torn-down proxy session and Colab showed "disconnected". Fix: `toolCallTimeoutMs: 180000` on the `mcp-colab` entry in the DSH profile's `cordis.patch.yml` (hot-reloads in place). Operationally: have Colab open and accept promptly; a retry then succeeds.
- **Drive round trip via Option B `drive.mount()` is harness-dependent (corrected 2026-09-26).** A sentinel the Colab mount wrote under `Cygnus/colab_runs/` was read back, SHA-256 matching, by **another harness's** `cygnus:` rclone token. The workstation's Claude Code harness has only a `gdrive:` remote (`scope = drive.file`), and there the same paths are **not visible** (`rclone cat` exit 3, directory not found). Both observations hold, for different tokens. Where data lives and who can see it is recorded per harness in `storage/locations.jsonl` (`python -m cygnus.storage list | check`; `docs/STORAGE.md`).
- **Measured leg throughputs (2026-09-26, 5 MiB payloads):** workstation → Drive via rclone **0.80 MiB/s**; Colab VM → Drive via the mount **30.8 MiB/s** (0.2 s write incl. `os.fsync`; read-back ~418 MiB/s is page-cache, ignored as not representative). Consequence: anything that must land in Drive is cheaper to move from a cloud VM; anything archive-bound downloads fastest from the cloud too (archive health check: exit 0, 153 s from Google's egress vs 5.8 s single-service locally).
- **Archive behavior from Google's egress IPs (2026-09-26, full 24-service check):** 18 ok / 6 unavailable / 0 error. `earthdata.nasa.gov` returned **HTTP 403 Forbidden** from Google IPs (reached from the workstation on other days) — expect Colab campaigns to report it `unavailable`; ESO TAP read-timed out at 120 s exactly as recorded locally; ASF/USGS/FIRMS/Worldview remain account- or viewer-only by design.
- **Compute budget:** Colab Pro, ~80 compute units user-stated 2026-09-26; CPU-only runtimes only (no GPU/TPU). Units actually consumed must be read from Colab's *Resources* panel and recorded as observed — never estimated or quoted from a rate that was not seen.
- **Campaign products are transient by design** (checksums recorded, FITS discarded, L2 replay re-verifies on demand), so a cloud batch ships back only KB-scale artifacts: `state/ledger.sqlite` (companion, never merged), the batch journal, logs and reports. See `docs/COLAB_HANDOFF.md` and `notebooks/cygnus_batch_colab.ipynb`.
